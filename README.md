# Sign-Up-Form

This is a project to practice HTML forms, and a variety of CSS (pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, custom properties, positioning (relative, absolute, selectors, relative units, etc). This project only uses HTML and CSS.

<h3>The techniques I used:</h3>

* the reference to the picture uses flexbox to center the text and uses absolute positioning to put the text at the bottom
* declared a custom property for the uniform padding on the left side
* all inputs are required, and have placeholders
* if input is invalid, the input shows a red border
* phone number has a simple validation requiring 10 numbers to be inputted, otherwise a red border and an x shows
* min password length set with minlength and red border and x indicator shown if password is too short
* form submission button is placed outside of the form "container" by using absolute positioning, so is the "already have an account" text

<h3>To do:</h3>
* input hover effects
