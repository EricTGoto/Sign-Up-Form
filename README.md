# Sign-Up-Form

This is a project to practice HTML forms, and a variety of CSS (pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, custom properties, positioning (relative, absolute, selectors, relative units, etc).

<h3>The techniques I used:</h3>

* the reference to the picture uses flexbox to center the text and uses absolute positioning to put the text at the bottom
* declared a custom property for the uniform padding on the left side
* all inputs are required, and have placeholders
* if input is invalid, the input shows a red border
* form submission button is placed outside of the form "container" by using absolute positioning, so is the "already have an account" text

To do:
* validation for phone number (don't allow anything but numbers)
* min password length
* min password indicator if password is too short
* input hover effects
